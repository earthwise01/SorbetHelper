## **Entities**

### Strawberry (With Node Based Return)
functionally a regular strawberry, however upon grabbing one Madeline is placed into a bubble and moved along a path (similarly to a vanilla Key (With Return))<br>
can also have wings or seeds and has a customisable delay between grabbing the berry and being bubbled

(note: if you'd rather if the bubble took Madeline to the latest spawn point no matter what instead of a specifc location, I'd recommend you also check out [Lunatic Helper](https://gamebanana.com/mods/53692)'s return strawberries instead)

### Resizable Waterfall
a custom waterfall with the appearance/resizablity of a vanilla Big Waterfall and the behavior of a vanilla small Waterfall

has options for toggling visual detail lines (disabling this will make it appear visually more like a small Waterfall), making it ignore any solids in its way, and customising visual depth (although this isn't super useful currently given that it looks weird when behind Madeline due to the wavy distortion effect still staying in the foreground anyway)

### Dash Falling Block
a Falling Block which falls upon being dashed into rather than when being grabbed or stood on

has options to customize its visual depth and SFX, along with toggles to allow activating it in the same ways as vanilla Falling Blocks as well

### Crumble On Flag Block
similar to a vanilla Crumble Wall On Rumble except it breaks when a flag is enabled and will also reappear if the flag is disabled again

has an optional toggle to reverse flag activation behavior

### Flag Toggled Killbox
same as a vanilla Killbox but with the added ability to able be flag-toggleable

### Kill Zone
kills Madeline on contact, optionally flag-toggleable
